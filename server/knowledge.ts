# About Housing Connect

Housing Connect is an affordable housing platform that helps individuals and families find and apply for affordable housing opportunities in one place. It simplifies the process by allowing users to create a single profile that can be used to apply to multiple housing developments.

## How Housing Connect Works

1. Users create a profile with their household information
2. They can search for available housing that matches their needs
3. Users can submit applications to multiple housing options
4. All applications can be tracked in one dashboard

The platform eliminates the need to fill out separate applications for each development.

# Eligibility Criteria

Eligibility for Housing Connect programs depends on several factors:

## Income Requirements

- Households must typically earn between 30% and 165% of Area Median Income (AMI)
- Income limits vary by household size and specific housing development
- For example, in 2023, a family of four with income between $38,200 and $208,065 might qualify for different housing options

## What is AMI?

Area Median Income (AMI) is a metric used to determine eligibility for affordable housing programs:

- AMI is the midpoint of a region's income distribution â€“ half of households earn more and half earn less
- AMI is calculated annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
- AMI varies by location and is adjusted for household size
- Housing programs typically define affordability in relation to percentages of AMI:
  * Extremely Low Income: 0-30% of AMI
  * Very Low Income: 31-50% of AMI
  * Low Income: 51-80% of AMI
  * Moderate Income: 81-120% of AMI
  * Middle Income: 121-165% of AMI

## Other Eligibility Factors

- Household size must match apartment size requirements (minimum and maximum people)
- Some developments may have specific preferences (e.g., for current community residents)

## Lottery System

Many affordable housing opportunities use a lottery system:

- Income verification (pay stubs, tax returns, W-2 forms)
- Asset documentation (bank statements)

These documents help verify eligibility and should be kept current.

The typical timeline for Housing Connect applications:

1. Application submission
2. Initial eligibility screening (2-4 weeks)
3. Document verification (1-2 months)
4. Interview (if selected)
5. Final eligibility determination
6. Apartment offer (if qualified)

The entire process can take several months to a year depending on availability.

# Rent Calculation

## How Rent is Determined

For many affordable housing programs, your rent will be calculated based on:

- Your total household income
- The specific housing program rules
- The AMI level the unit is designated for

Common rent calculations include:
- 30% of adjusted household income (common in public housing)
- Fixed rent based on AMI percentage (common in LIHTC properties)
- Market rate minus subsidy (voucher programs)

## Income Recertification

Most affordable housing programs require annual income recertification:
- You must report changes in income or household composition
- Your rent may be adjusted based on income changes
- Failure to report income changes may result in back-rent charges or program termination
