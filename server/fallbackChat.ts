    question: "How long does it take to hear back?",
    answer: "The affordable housing application process can take several months to a year depending on availability. The typical timeline includes: application submission, initial eligibility screening (2-4 weeks), document verification (1-2 months), interview (if selected), final eligibility determination, apartment offer (if qualified), and lease signing. Make sure your contact information is correct in your Housing Connect account.",

  {
    question: "What is Housing Connect?",
    answer: "Housing Connect is an affordable housing platform that helps individuals and families find and apply for affordable housing opportunities in one place. It simplifies the process by allowing users to create a single profile that can be used to apply to multiple housing developments. The platform eliminates the need to fill out separate applications for each development.",

  {
    question: "What is AMI?",
    answer: "Area Median Income (AMI) is a metric used to determine eligibility for affordable housing programs. AMI is the midpoint of a region's income distribution â€“ half of households earn more and half earn less. It's calculated annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and varies by location and household size. Housing programs typically define affordability in relation to AMI percentages: Extremely Low Income (0-30%), Very Low Income (31-50%), Low Income (51-80%), Moderate Income (81-120%), and Middle Income (121-165%).",
    keywords: ["ami", "area median income", "income", "median", "eligibility", "qualification", "percentage", "income level", "income limit"]
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't meet AMI requirements?",
    answer: "If your income is above the maximum AMI threshold, you should explore housing programs with higher income limits, mixed-income developments with units at various AMI levels, or market-rate units with preferential rent. If your income is below the minimum AMI requirement, look for developments with lower AMI requirements (some go as low as 30% AMI), explore deeply subsidized programs like public housing or Section 8, check emergency housing assistance programs, or consider rental assistance programs that help bridge the gap. Some supportive housing options are also available for extremely low incomes.",

  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm rejected?",
    answer: "If you're rejected, you'll receive a notice explaining the reason and you may have the right to appeal within 10-14 business days. To appeal: 1) Review the rejection reason, 2) Gather supporting documentation, 3) File a written appeal by the deadline, 4) Include all supporting documents, 5) Request a hearing if available, and 6) Consider seeking help from a housing advocate. If your appeal is denied, alternatives include applying to different developments with criteria you can meet, exploring emergency assistance programs, contacting housing counseling agencies, considering roommate arrangements, investigating rent subsidy programs, or community land trusts.",

  },
  {
    question: "What if I have credit issues?",
    answer: "If you have credit problems, you can still apply but should: provide explanations for negative items on your credit report, show evidence of payment plans for outstanding debts, include reference letters from previous landlords or employers, consider credit counseling programs and include certificates of completion with your application. Some housing developments have less stringent credit requirements or consider extenuating circumstances, particularly for affordable housing programs.",

  {
    question: "What if I have a criminal record?",
    answer: "With a criminal background, focus on developments that follow fair chance housing policies, provide evidence of rehabilitation and positive community involvement, include character references from employers, counselors, or community leaders. Be aware that certain convictions have time limitations and may not be considered after a specific period. Housing advocacy organizations can help identify housing providers with more inclusive policies. If rejected based on criminal history, you have the right to appeal and explain the circumstances or provide evidence of rehabilitation.",

  },
  {
    question: "Am I eligible for affordable housing?",
    answer: "Eligibility depends on factors like your income, household size, and specific development requirements. Typically, households must earn between 30% and 165% of Area Median Income (AMI) to qualify for different housing options. Other eligibility factors include household size matching apartment requirements, credit history, rental history, criminal background checks, and possibly citizenship or eligible immigration status. Some properties also have age restrictions for senior housing.",

  },
  {
    question: "Is there an application fee?",
    answer: "There is no fee to create a Housing Connect profile. Some developments may have application fees, but many affordable housing options have no application fees. Any required fees will be clearly indicated in the listing details before you apply.",
    keywords: ["fee", "cost", "price", "payment", "charge", "expense", "free", "pay", "application fee"]
  },
  {
    question: "How many housing options can I apply for?",
    answer: "You can apply to as many housing options as you qualify for through Housing Connect. There is no limit to the number of applications you can submit. In fact, applying to multiple developments can increase your chances of securing affordable housing.",
    keywords: ["how many", "limit", "multiple", "several", "number", "applications", "options", "listings", "developments"]
  },
  {
    question: "What if my information changes?",
    answer: "Update your Housing Connect profile immediately if there are changes to your household size or income. Keeping your information current ensures you're considered for appropriate housing options and prevents delays in processing. Most affordable housing programs require annual income recertification, and failure to report income changes may result in back-rent charges or program termination.",
    keywords: ["change", "update", "modification", "information", "profile", "details", "income change", "household change", "status change"]
  },
  {
    question: "What types of housing are available?",
    answer: "Housing Connect offers various types of affordable housing options including: Public Housing (government-owned properties managed by local housing authorities), Section 8/Housing Choice Vouchers (subsidies for private market apartments), Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Properties (privately developed affordable housing), Mitchell-Lama Housing (middle-income rental and cooperative housing), Inclusionary Housing (affordable units in market-rate developments), and Supportive Housing (combines affordable housing with supportive services).",
    keywords: ["types", "housing", "options", "available", "properties", "apartments", "units", "public housing", "section 8", "vouchers", "tax credit", "supportive"]
  },
  {
    question: "How is rent calculated?",
    answer: "For many affordable housing programs, your rent will be calculated based on your total household income, the specific housing program rules, and the AMI level the unit is designated for. Common rent calculations include 30% of adjusted household income (common in public housing), fixed rent based on AMI percentage (common in LIHTC properties), or market rate minus subsidy (voucher programs). Most programs require annual income recertification to adjust rent as needed.",
    keywords: ["rent", "cost", "price", "payment", "calculate", "determination", "amount", "monthly", "income", "percentage"]
  },
  {
    question: "What is the lottery system?",
    answer: "Many affordable housing opportunities use a lottery system where applications received during the open period are randomly assigned a number. Applications are then reviewed in lottery number order, so having a low lottery number increases your chances of being selected. Some applicants may receive preference based on local requirements such as residency, disability status, or other criteria.",
    keywords: ["lottery", "random", "selection", "chance", "number", "odds", "preference", "priority", "chosen", "selection process"]
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be a citizen?",
    answer: "Eligibility requirements vary by program. While some require U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status, others may be available to all residents regardless of immigration status. If you have immigration status concerns, look for non-federally funded housing options which may have different requirements, or contact community-based housing organizations that often have more flexible criteria. Legal aid organizations can provide guidance specific to your situation.",
    keywords: ["citizen", "citizenship", "immigration", "status", "undocumented", "legal", "residency", "green card", "visa", "documentation"]
  },
  {
    question: "What are my rights as a tenant?",
    answer: "As an affordable housing tenant, you have rights including the right to fair treatment without discrimination, the right to a safe and habitable dwelling, the right to proper notice before landlord entry, the right to request repairs, protection against unfair eviction, and reasonable accommodations for disabilities. Many jurisdictions have additional tenant protections under local housing laws.",
    keywords: ["rights", "tenant rights", "protections", "legal", "fair housing", "discrimination", "eviction", "repairs", "accommodations", "landlord"]
  },
  {
    question: "What is a log number and what does it mean?",
    answer: "A log number is a unique identifier assigned to your Housing Connect application when you apply to a specific housing development. This number confirms your application was successfully submitted and is being processed. You can use your log number to check your application status and for reference in any communications with the housing provider. The log number is typically assigned in chronological order of application receipt and may be used in the lottery selection process.",
    keywords: ["log number", "log", "application number", "confirmation number", "reference number", "id number", "identifier", "application id", "tracking number"]
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know when my application has been received?",
    answer: "After submitting your application on Housing Connect, you will receive a confirmation email with a log number. This log number confirms your application was successfully received and is being processed. You can also check your Housing Connect dashboard, which will display all your submitted applications and their status. If you don't receive a confirmation within 48 hours, you should contact the Housing Connect support team to verify your application status.",
    keywords: ["application received", "confirmation", "receipt", "submitted", "verify submission", "application status", "confirmation email", "notification"]
  },
  {
    question: "What is the waiting list process?",
    answer: "The waiting list process for Housing Connect works as follows: 1) After the lottery, eligible applicants who weren't immediately selected are placed on a waiting list, 2) Your position depends on your lottery number and any preference categories you qualify for, 3) As units become available, applicants are contacted in waiting list order, 4) The waiting list may remain active for 1-2 years depending on the development, 5) You must respond promptly when contacted (typically within 5-10 business days), 6) You'll need to verify your continued eligibility when reached on the list. You can check your waiting list status through your Housing Connect account or by contacting the housing provider directly with your log number.",
    keywords: ["waiting list", "waitlist", "wait time", "queue", "position", "ranking", "order", "when will I hear back", "status update", "line", "priority"]
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I miss my interview?",
    answer: "If you miss your scheduled interview for affordable housing: 1) Contact the housing provider immediately to explain your situation and request a reschedule, 2) Be aware that most providers allow one reschedule if you have a valid reason and contact them promptly, 3) If you don't contact them typically within 5 business days of the missed appointment, your application may be disqualified, and 4) You'll need to provide documentation explaining the absence (like a doctor's note or employer letter) in many cases. Always update your contact information in your Housing Connect profile to ensure you receive interview notifications, and check your email and phone regularly during the application process.",
    keywords: ["missed interview", "reschedule", "appointment", "couldn't attend", "no-show", "didn't go", "absent", "couldn't make it", "missed appointment", "second chance"]
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between affordable and market-rate housing?",
    answer: "Affordable housing refers to units with regulated rents set to be affordable to households within specific income ranges (typically 30-165% AMI), while market-rate housing has rents determined by market conditions with no income restrictions. The key differences are: 1) Price - affordable housing has below-market rents based on income level, 2) Eligibility - affordable housing requires meeting income and other qualifications, 3) Application process - affordable housing typically requires a formal application process, sometimes with lotteries, 4) Rent increases - affordable units have regulated rent increases, while market-rate units can increase based on market conditions, and 5) Income verification - affordable housing requires annual income recertification, while market-rate does not.",
    keywords: ["affordable vs market", "market rate", "difference", "comparison", "compare", "regular housing", "normal rent", "subsidized", "regular apartment", "price difference"]
  },
  {
    question: "How often do I need to update my application?",
    answer: "You should update your Housing Connect profile whenever significant changes occur to your household or income situation. While there's no strict schedule for profile updates, it's recommended to review your information at least every 6 months. For active applications on waiting lists, you'll typically be required to respond to annual update requests from housing providers to confirm continued interest and eligibility. If you're selected for an interview, you'll need to provide current documentation, so keeping your profile updated will make this process smoother. Failure to update significant changes may result in application rejection if discovered during verification.",
